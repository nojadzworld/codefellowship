# CodeFellowship

The Code Fellowship is an app that allows people learning to code to connect with each other and support each other on their coding journeys.

## Instructions

- Build from the command line inside the `codefellowship` directory with `./gradlew bootRun`
    - Set up a Postgres server with a database named "codefellowship".
    - The `src/main/resources/application.properties` file contains generic user/name password resources change these to match your Postgres server username and password.
    - While the app is running direct your web browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). This will load the main login page.
